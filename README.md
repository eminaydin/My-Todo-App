## The Project
Todo apps are basic starting point of javascript exercises.For the same purpose I wanted to create one of it and see the challenges that I'm going to face. Main tool in this project is Javascript without any framework getting involved in it. A little bit of magic css and boom, its there.

## Challenges
To be honest, I didn't face too many difficulties along the way. The logic part didn't take me too long so I spent more time on the styles which kept me busy for a while because I wanted to make sure to have a satisfying result at the end.
